<h1>First Journal Entry (9/21/23)</h1>
<p>This is my first journal entry.</p>
<p>Today we're learning how to push and publish our local code to github so that my code is saved if anything happens to my computer. In order to push the code you have to:</p>
<p>
	cd ./desktop/Ody-Shi.github.io</p>
<p>git add .</p>	
	<p>git commit -m "what you're doing"</p>
	<p>git push</p>
<br>
<p>
	Helpful commands:</p>
	<p>ls :lists things in the folder</p> 
	<p>git status :tells you what you've changed (green=already added, red=changed but haven't added)</p>
	<p>cd :change depository</p>
	<p>. :go in</p>
	<p>.. :go out</p>
