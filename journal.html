<h1>First Journal Entry (9/21/23)</h1>
<p>This is my first journal entry.</p>
<p>Today we're learning how to push and publish our local code to github so that my code is saved if anything happens to my computer. In order to push the code you have to:</p>
<p>
	cd ./desktop/Ody-Shi.github.io</p>
<p>git add .</p>	
	<p>git commit -m "what you're doing"</p>
	<p>git push</p>
<br>
<p>
	Helpful commands:</p>
	<p>ls :lists things in the folder</p> 
	<p>git status :tells you what you've changed (green=already added, red=changed but haven't added)</p>
	<p>cd :change depository</p>
	<p>. :go in</p>
	<p>.. :go out</p>

<p>Today we learned how to make animations with divs. Using attributes like animation-name, animation-duration, and animation-iteration-count, we can set the divs to different frames under the name @keyframes (animation-name). Insert percentages like 30% to set a frame for a percentage of the duration. This can help making projects and transitions look smoother and cooler.</p>
<p>Ex:animation-name:dance;</p>
	<p>	animation-duration:3s;</p>
	<p>	animation-iteration-count:infinite;</p>
	<p>	position:absolute;</p>
	<p>@keyframes dance{</p>

<p>In this class, we started to learn the structure of Javascript. Javascript code functions in the "script" tag. We talked about console.log which creates a message in the Console Inspect of a website. Event listeners basically wait for an event like "click" or "mouseenter" and then does an action or documents the action when it hears the event.</p>
<p>Ex:document.addEventListener("keypress", function(event){
		console.log(event) </p>
<h1>Journal (10/24/23)</h1>
<p>We worked on making a jumpscare project for Halloween this class. I did this by using event listeners to display an action on click or keypress. I also used variables as part of the javascript code to make actions occur on the second click rather than on every click. In addition, I used the "audio" tag to play a jumpscare sound to make it seem more realistic. This project was pretty cool and fun to make and it was good practice for learning how to code javascript.</p>
<h1>Journal (11/7/23)</h1>
<p>This week we made a cookie project that uses javascript to make the code create cookies (divs) for me and count the cookies. I did this by using "function makeCookie (){}" in addition to "createElement" and "appendChild" to make a div and putting it in the body.</p>
<h1>Journal (11/14/23)</h1>
<p>Some more on functions: Functions are an action with an input and an output. Under the name of a function, you can put a placeholder in the input and the output and you can replace both placeholders with a value/phrase. The new value/phrase will have the action applied to it.</p>
<h1>Journal (11/21/23)</h1>
<p>Today I finished my gift project which utilizes a number counter to progress the slides with clicks. The premise of the project is for each image to be layered by another image (goes from farmer to scope to painting). The end is damn because damn.</p>
<h1>Journal (12/05/23)</h1>
<p>Using ChatGPT, I learned that to store date using code I have use a programming language like python or SQL (database). With these languages, I can use variables and groups to store specific values in the code. You can hold data in JavaScript, but this is only client-side and not the most efficient method.</p>
<h1>Journal (12/12/23)</h1>
<p>Today, we used a "for-loop" to create divs to any amount that we set it to. I created chairs and used a counter to generate chair until 1000. 
	Ex: 
	for (var counter = 0; counter <1000; counter = counter + 1){
		makeChair(counter) </p>
<h1>Journal (12/19/23)</h1>
<p>For this project, I made a holiday card inspired by the pizza codesketch. It was set in a paintball field that I've actually gone to and you can shoot paintballs by clicking. There are 4 colors you can use and you can change colors by clicking on the 4 displayed.</p>
