<h1>First Journal Entry (9/21/23)</h1>
<p>This is my first journal entry.</p>
<p>Today we're learning how to push and publish our local code to github so that my code is saved if anything happens to my computer. In order to push the code you have to:</p>
<p>
	cd ./desktop/Ody-Shi.github.io</p>
<p>git add .</p>	
	<p>git commit -m "what you're doing"</p>
	<p>git push</p>
<br>
<p>
	Helpful commands:</p>
	<p>ls :lists things in the folder</p> 
	<p>git status :tells you what you've changed (green=already added, red=changed but haven't added)</p>
	<p>cd :change depository</p>
	<p>. :go in</p>
	<p>.. :go out</p>

<p>Today we learned how to make animations with divs. Using attributes like animation-name, animation-duration, and animation-iteration-count, we can set the divs to different frames under the name @keyframes (animation-name). Insert percentages like 30% to set a frame for a percentage of the duration. This can help making projects and transitions look smoother and cooler.</p>
<p>Ex:animation-name:dance;</p>
	<p>	animation-duration:3s;</p>
	<p>	animation-iteration-count:infinite;</p>
	<p>	position:absolute;</p>
	<p>@keyframes dance{</p>

<p>In this class, we started to learn the structure of Javascript. Javascript code functions in the "script" tag. We talked about console.log which creates a message in the Console Inspect of a website. Event listeners basically wait for an event like "click" or "mouseenter" and then does an action or documents the action when it hears the event.</p>
<p>Ex:document.addEventListener("keypress", function(event){
		console.log(event) </p>
